## Workflow

First the data were linked to English LSOAs (2021 version). If the data were provided with linked LSOAs, often in Excel format, they were converted into CSVs for linkage (for example, land use). If like for the Census, individual variables were provided in separate CSVs, they were linked into one file to link into the main LSOA dataset.
